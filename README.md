========
An object relational model which uses typescript annotations to define the data
schema. It can be used in node applications and includes bindings for angular 
js dependancy injection. It can also be used on the frontend with a little setup
and will talk via an api.

Requests, Bugs, and Roadmap
===========================
Please submit all requests for features and bug requests via the github
 [bug tracker](../../issues), the roadmap will be tracked via github
 [milestones](../../milestones)

Testing
=======
* Tests will be placed along side the file in question in a file labeled <name>.spec.ts
* Tests will be written using Mocha with the describe statement containing the name of the file including the directory
   (ex. 'node/connect' for 'node/connect.ts')
* If you need to create classes for testing (ex. testing an abstract class) place them in a <name>.spec.class.ts
* All public interfaces must be tested
* In order to fix a bug you must write a test first, this is to avoid regressions
* The test reporter should always show 100% coverage. If something doesn't make sense to test you can ignore it using special comments

Directory structure
=======
* shared - contains the files shared across all vendors
* node - contains the files for use via nodejs
* mocks - contains mock objects for use in testing
